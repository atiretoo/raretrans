#' raretrans: A package for creating and updating Bayesian priors for matrix population models
#'
#' This package provides functions that combine data on transitions with prior beliefs about
#' transition probabilities and fertilities. Includes functions to create matrix population models from a combination
#' of data on stage/age transitions and Bayesian prior information. This
#' compensates for structural problems caused by missing observatons of rare
#' transitions.
