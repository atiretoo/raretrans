 abstract = {An 18-year study of reproduction and survival of the Florida Everglade (Snail) Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus) has revealed the following: extremely poor nesting success (only 13.6% of nests found at the nest-building stage successful); extremely long breeding seasons (some reproductive activity in almost all months in good years); frequent multiple brooding and frequent renesting after failure; low egg hatchability (81%); high failure rates due to nest collapse, desertion, and predation; extremely high survival of juveniles and adults under good water conditions; and high vulnerability to drought due to near total dependency on a single species of drought-sensitive snail for food. Despite low nesting success, the species has increased rapidly under good conditions, mainly because of multiple nesting attempts within long breeding seasons and high survival rates of free-flying birds. Nesting success varied significantly between regions and nest substrates, but not as a function of seasons or solitary vs. colonial nesting. While nesting success was reduced in low water years, this effect was at least partly due to heavy use of poor nest substrates under such conditions. Clutch size and numbers of young per successful nest varied with regions, but not as a function of seasons or water levels. The effects of coloniality on clutch size and numbers of young were inconsistent. Significant effects of nest-substrate types on clutch size and numbers of young were apparently artifacts of substrate differences between regions.},

 abstract = {The effects of periodic environmental fluctuations on population viability are examined based on the use of environmental states. The approach is applied to the Florida population of the Snail Kite, an endangered wetland hawk that feeds almost solely on one species of snail. A preliminary assessment based on stochastic population fluctuations indicated that populations became viable when initial size surpassed 300 individuals. However, changes in population size between consecutive years, nesting success, and the length of the breeding season were all highly and positively related to water level and rainfall characteristics, which are highly periodic. Low water conditions cause Snail Kites to disperse and result in low recruitment, increased adult mortality, and population declines. The effects of cyclic drought were explored using stage-based life tables for three different water conditions or environmental states (drought, lag years following drought, and high years). Population sizes predicted by the model were closely associated with actual kite population counts. Deterministic projections indicated that kite populations would increase when intervals between droughts exceeded 3.3 yr, but stochastic simulations found that populations did not become viable unless intervals exceeded 4.3 yr. The model was sensitive to estimates of survivorship. The use of the environmental state approach is compared to standard techniques for population viability analyses (PVA), and the implications of the model for Everglades water management are discussed.},

 abstract = {A simple difference equation model was developed to provide additional perspective on observed mortality and trend data on Yellowstone grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis). Records of mortalities of adult females from 1959 to 1985 were utilized, in conjunction with data on females with cubs. The overall downward trend of observed numbers of females with cubs generally agrees with the model calculations but does not adequately reflect mortality from 1970 to 1974. The model may be useful in developing a composite index of population trend.},
